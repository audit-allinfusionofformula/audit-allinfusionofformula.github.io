- **Failed Transactions**:  
  - If a vesting transaction fails:  
    - The equivalent **USDT amount** will be reflected in the app, regardless of the initial payment token used.  
    - Failed vesting transactions will be labeled as **Non-Vested Amount** in the app.  
    - This amount can either:  
      - Be **re-obtained** (withdrawn).  
      - Be used for **future vesting transactions**.

### 6. Transparency and App Interface

- All transactions, including successful and failed vesting, will be clearly visible on the app.  
- Failed transactions will be marked, allowing users to take necessary actions promptly.  

### 7. Admin Fee
